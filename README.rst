=============
Collatz
=============

This package is a set of utilities for dealing with the collatz conjecture

Contents
-------------

The package contains two functions.  The first is reduce(), which takes the 
integer or list of integers in and returns the collapsed solution. The second 
is tree(), which takes in an integer and returns the collatz tree from the 
starting value specified.

If you want to learn more about the functions, simply `import collatz` and either look for the
help on `collatz.tree()` or `collatz.reduce()`.

Why
-------------

There's no package for it, so might as well make one. Let me know of any features you
may want to see.  Thanks and enjoy!
